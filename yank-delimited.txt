(There is a )
place where the sidewalk ends
"And before the "
street begins,
{And there }
the grass grows soft and white,
[And there the ]
sun burns crimson bright,
'And there '
the moon-bird rests from his flight
<To >
cool in the peppermint wind.

"Let "
us leave this place where the smoke blows black
[And ]
the dark street winds and bends.
'Past the pits '
where the asphalt flowers grow
(We shall walk )
with a walk that is measured and slow,
<And watch where >
the chalk-white arrows go
{To the place }
where the sidewalk ends.

[Yes we'll walk ] 
with a walk that is measured and slow,
"And we'll go where "
the chalk-white arrows go,
{For the children}
, they mark, and the children, they know
'The place where '
the sidewalk ends.
